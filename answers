Your app is it in early phase. I am glad that you brought it to the right person at right time, as I know the application architecture and how to build application in optimized and scalable manner.

I am expert in payment gateway integration, full-stack development i.e frontend + backend, server monitoring/scaling/deploying.
So you will find a complete architect solution from me.

Your app is not currently fluent. It just crashes anywhere.

Secondly how was your app deployed to server. I don't see automated tools used.



-get some unit tests written
Currently there doesn't seem tests written for current code, except the default ones.
I will build all, I am expert in it.

-fix loose ends, UX issues, etc
Please make a list for all the issues that you want to fix. I see that there are alot of loose ends.

-ensure application is reliable
please describe your expectations from the app, I will make sure it is reliable.

-add safety checks at various points (make sure user doesn't upload more files than remaining server HDD space, etc)
we will be monitoring server. As later on we will be moving to S3 so this is not a thing to worry about. Initially server has good enough space to handle alot of images.
